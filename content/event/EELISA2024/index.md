I had the privilege of attending the EELISA Skill Up: Inspiring Innovation & Entrepreneurship event, organized by the EELISA European University Alliance, from December 9th to 11th. 
This dynamic event brought together an incredible group of researchers, educators, and innovators to explore ways to build sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems.

It was a fantastic opportunity to learn from the entrepreneurship ecosystems expert [Christina Theodoraki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-theodoraki-083bb548), share ideas with like-minded professionals, and gain fresh insights into how to develop more effective research ecosystems.

This event serves as a reminder of the power of collaboration and the incredible potential that comes when we join forces to create sustainable, impactful innovation.
