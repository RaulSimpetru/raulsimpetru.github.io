ISEK is the meeting place for all EMG enthusiasts. 
Knowing this we thought it would be the perfect place to showcase our latest work on [MyoGestic](https://raulsimpetru.github.io/featured_works/myogestic/).

We are very grateful for the opportunity to present our work and meet so many other researchers we only knew from papers before.

Since ISEK 2024 was in Japan, we decided to spend some extra time after the congress to explore the country and its culture.
