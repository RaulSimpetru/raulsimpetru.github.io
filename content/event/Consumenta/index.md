How does an intelligent neuro-orthosis help restore movement in paralyzed hands?

We, the GraspAgain team ([n-squared lab @ FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.nsquared.tf.fau.de/)), have a bold vision: to restore hand function in individuals with neuromuscular impairments. In collaboration with the Chair of Factory Automation and Production Systems (FAPS), we are developing a neuro-orthosis capable of restoring hand functionality to a degree that allows affected individuals to independently perform more than 90% of daily tasks. 

To achieve this, the neuro-orthosis is paired with a non-invasive human-machine interface that deciphers the user's movement intentions.
