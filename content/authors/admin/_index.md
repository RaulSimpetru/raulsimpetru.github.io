## About Me

I’m a Ph.D. student at the nsquared-lab (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg), specializing in restoring hand function for individuals with neuromuscular impairments. My research focuses on developing intelligent neural interfacing systems that decode motor intent using electromyography. By integrating neurophysiology, machine learning, and user-centered design, I strive to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and clinical applications to enhance quality of life.
